# BME 499: AI in BME
The goal of this course is to introduce and apply AI tools to problems in BME.

AI and machine learning algorithms have had a major impact on biomedical science in the past decade.  AI algorithms can learn patterns from biomedical data sets to provide actionable insights on disease diagnosis or treatment. This course will focus on practical applications of AI in BME with hands-on tutorials.  

This course will provide an overview of a wide range of AI and machine-learning tools (clustering, regression, decision trees, random forests and neural networks), biomedical data sets (imaging, omics and data-mining) and diseases (cancer, infectious-, cardiovascular- and neurological-). 

Software used - MATLAB. No programming experience necessary beyond Eng 101.
